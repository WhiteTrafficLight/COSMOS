"The word 'atom' was coined by Democritus, derived from the Greek word meaning 'indivisible.' The term itself conveys the idea that atoms are the ultimate particles of matter, and any attempt to divide them further is impossible. He believed that all objects, including ourselves, are intricate assemblies of atoms.

Democritus famously declared, 'Nothing exists except atoms and empty space.'

According to his argument, when a knife slices through an apple, it passes through the empty spaces between atoms. If there were no empty spaces, the knife would hit an indivisible atom, making the act of cutting impossible.

Consider, for example, cutting a cone into two sections—would the exposed surfaces be equal? Democritus said no. Because of the cone’s slope, one cross-section would be slightly smaller than the other. If they were equal, then the object would not be a cone but a cylinder. Yet, even if a knife could cut a perfect cylinder, Democritus argued that, at an atomic level, matter would still be rough and uneven.

Although his atomic theory does not fully match modern physics, his reasoning was remarkably logical, insightful, and rooted in observable experience. In essence, the conclusions he drew were fundamentally correct."
